# Peanut-To-The-Dungeon
Peanut to the Dungeon is a game about a cat named Peanut, that goes to the Dungeon.
I'm making this game open source for anybody who wants to look at the code for some reason.
I'm supposed to "choose a license" for this thing, and I chose no license, instead, here is the license:

Do whatever you want with this. I literally don't care.
I'm not trying to reserve any rights.
I just made a game for fun and anyone who wants to have fun with me can.

I'm also happy to see anyone who wants to try to optimize the game more, or if they found a bug they can report it and if I get bored enough then I might fix it.
