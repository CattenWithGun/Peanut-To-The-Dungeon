# Peanut-To-The-Dungeon
Peanut to the Dungeon is a game about a cat named Peanut, that goes to the Dungeon.
I'm making this game open source for anybody who wants to look at the code for some reason.
I'm supposed to "choose a license" for this thing, and I chose no license, instead, here is the license:

Do whatever you want with this. I literally don't care.
I'm not trying to reserve any rights.
I just made a game for fun and anyone who wants to have fun with me can.
